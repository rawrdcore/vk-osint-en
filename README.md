# TOOLS FOR OSINT VKONTAKTE

The most useful and effective tools are collected here, with the exception of bots with leaks and hyped applications that have long lost most of their functionality (for example, 220vk: VK eventually gave more anonymity to users and cut the API, so now it is effective to use it to fix user sessions.)


## Sites:

https://topdb.ru/username - shows old copies of pages, log with VPN (the database is small, but profile dumps are unique. That is, if a copy of the page there is on top.db, then it is very likely that you will not find it in other archives)

https://photo-map.ru - search for photos in the selected location (the search is carried out by VKontakte photos from open profiles and group where the location is indicated)

https://search4faces.com - search for accounts by face (one of the best reverse search services on VKontakte)

https://bigbookname.com - search either for google dorks (and yandex dorks), or by substituting the username and ID in the URL (another archive of currently open pages. Url substitution: https://bigbookname.com/user/name-surname-12345)



## Telegram bots:

https://t.me/VKHistoryRobot - old copies of account data (the bot provides a dump of the main profile page - avatars and bio, the period of copies from 2010 to the present)

https://t.me/friendly_graph_bot - collects graphs of friends of the account (the bot only works with open profiles. At the moment, you can parse about 200 friends for free, the authors regularly adjust the price)

https://t.me/FindNameVk_bot - the history of changing surnames and the date of account creation

https://t.me/UniversalSearchRobot - search for VK accounts in "My World" and many other checks put together


## URL:

https://onli-vk.ru/pivatfriends.php?id=12345 - search for account friends by id (the copies are extremely old, so you can find a lot of interesting things)



## Applications in VK:

[InfoApp](https://vk.com/app7183114) - provides information about the account, including a list of groups that it admin


## DORKS:
